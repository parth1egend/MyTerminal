NAME
    mycp - copy files

DESCRIPTION 
    In the first synopsis form, the cp utility copies the contents of the source_file to the target_file.  In
    the second synopsis form, the contents of each named source_file is copied to the destination
    target_directory.  The names of the files themselves are not changed.  If cp detects an attempt to copy a
    file to itself, the copy will fail.

    The following options are available:

    -i  Cause cp to write a prompt to the standard error output before copying a file that would overwrite an
        existing file.  If the response from the standard input begins with the character ‘y’ or ‘Y’, the file
        copy is attempted.  (The -i option overrides any previous -n option.)

    -n  Do not overwrite an existing file.  (The -n option overrides any previous -i options.)

    -v  Cause cp to be verbose , showing files as they are copied.

    


IMPLEMENTATION

    mycp -{option} file file/directory
    Above is the format in which the command shall be executed.
    
    In case of more than 1 option , the last one would be dominative.
    If any option other than n,i,v is used , error will be prompted.

    mycp -nn file1 file2 would work;
    mycp -n -n file1 file2 would give error.

    The command works on strtok() function which will break the prompt string into pieces(max 4).
    The string tokens are then stored in an array.
    So the code considers array[2] as file1 and array[3] as file2 or directory.
    In case of -n -n type command array[3] would be file1 and array[2] would be '-n'.
    It would try to open the first file , here '-n'.Unable to do so, it will give error and code would not work.

    mycp -n text1.txt text2.txt
    mycp file1.txt file2.txt
    mycp file1 dir
    mycp -i file1 dir
    These are some examples of code that work.
