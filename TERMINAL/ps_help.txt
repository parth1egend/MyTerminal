NAME
    ps - process status


DESCRIPTION
    The ps utility displays a header line, followed by lines containing information about all of your processes
    that have controlling terminals.

    The options are as follows:

    -a Display information about other users' processes as well as your own.

    -e Display information about other users' processes, including those without controlling terminals.

    -f Display the uid, pid, parent pid, recent CPU usage, process start time, controlling tty, elapsed CPU
       usage, and the associated command.When used with -af and -ef it adds to the effect of the options.

    

IMPLEMENTATION

    myps -{options}
    Aboove is the format in which the command should be executed.

    myshell will execute the following 5 ps commands:
    1.myps
    2.myps -a
    3.myps -e
    4.myps -af 
    5.myps -ef

    Adding -f with the other options just increase the amount of details getting printed.

    myps -af      would work.
    myps -a -f    would not work.

    The command uses strtok() function which breaks the command string into different tokens.
    It stores the different strings into an array. The second element of the array is accessed to check for the options.
    So if their are more than 2 tokens it will give an error.
    Giving options other than the mentioned ones will also give an error.
