NAME
    myls - list directory contents

DESCRIPTION 
    For each operand that names a file of a type other than directory, ls displays its name as well as any
    requested, associated information.  For each operand that names a file of type directory, ls displays the
    names of files contained within that directory, as well as any requested, associated information.

    If no operands are given, the contents of the current directory are displayed.  If more than one operand is
    given, non-directory operands are displayed first; directory and non-directory operands are sorted
    separately and in lexicographical order.

    The following options are available:

    -S  Sort by size (largest file first)

    -a  Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot ('.')

    -l  List files in the long format

    -r  Reverse the order of the sort. Can be used with -t or -S options.

    -t  Sort by descending time modified(most recently modified first)


IMPLEMENTATION

    myls -{options}
    OR
    myls -{options} -{options}
    would give a proper output

    If the options are other than S,a,l,r,t then it will give error.
    Any propmt in format other than the above would give an error.

    If S and t options occur together than the latter options dominates the other.
    So myls -St executes myls -t.

    Commands like:
    myls -l -l
    myls -ll -S
    myls -llSr
    would give proper result.
